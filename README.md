 Today, we are using ML and algorithmic trading to create a trading program. We are also utilizing logistic regression as an alternative model to fine-tune our trading algo. All three models registered the same results. This tells us that in some trading cases, the resulting outcome will remain the same no matter how many different predictive models, regressions and fine-tuning one does to our base case.
